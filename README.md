   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## üéÆ Controls & Usage

### Keyboard Controls
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `‚Üë` `‚Üì` `‚Üê` `‚Üí` | Move snake |
| `G` | Toggle gesture control |
| `Space` | Restart game (when game over) |
| `ESC` | Exit application |

### Gesture Controls
| Gesture | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Swipe Up | Move snake up |
| Swipe Down | Move snake down |
| Swipe Left | Move snake left |
| Swipe Right | Move snake right |
| `ESC` (camera window) | Close camera view |

### Getting Started
1. Launch the application using `python app.py`
2. Use arrow keys to control the snake initially
3. Press `G` to activate gesture control mode
4. Position your hand in front of the webcam
5. Use clear, deliberate finger swipes to control the snake
6. Collect food items while avoiding the snake's body

## üîß Technical Architecture

### Core Components

- **Computer Vision**: MediaPipe integration for real-time hand landmark detection
- **Input Processing**: Multi-threaded input handling for responsive gameplay
- **Graphics Rendering**: Efficient sprite management and particle system

### Performance Optimizations
- Frame rate capping at 60 FPS for consistent gameplay
- Efficient collision detection algorithms
- Optimized particle rendering with object pooling
- Memory-efficient score persistence

## üìã Dependencies

Core dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`:

```
pygame>=2.0.0
opencv-python>=4.5.0
mediapipe>=0.8.0
numpy>=1.20.0
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Camera Settings
- Default camera index: 0 (adjustable in source code)
- Minimum resolution: 640x480
- Recommended lighting: Well-lit environment for optimal gesture recognition

### Performance Settings
- Visual effects can be toggled for performance optimization
- Particle count automatically adjusts based on system performance
- Frame rate limiting ensures consistent gameplay across different hardware

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Camera Not Detected**
- Ensure webcam is connected and not in use by other applications
- Check camera permissions in your operating system
- Try different camera indices if multiple cameras are available

**Poor Gesture Recognition**
- Ensure adequate lighting in the environment
- Keep hand clearly visible within camera frame
- Maintain appropriate distance from camera (arm's length)
- Avoid cluttered backgrounds

**Performance Issues**
- Close other resource-intensive applications
- Ensure adequate system resources are available

**Installation Problems**
- Verify Python version compatibility (3.7+)
- Use virtual environment for dependency isolation
- Check system-specific installation requirements for OpenCV
